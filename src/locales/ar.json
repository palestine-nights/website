I sit on the balcony, smelling the taste of freshly brewed tea with maramiya, like my grandmother used to prepare it, sipping delightfully, taking in it’s rich aroma and eating bite by bite my traditional breakfast - Manqooshe with Zaatar or white Cheese and listening to Palestinian music: sound of Oud that reminds me of my father when I was just a child... Or maybe it would be a dinner or lunch, when I can take some Eggplant Maqloobah or Musakhan, or anything else that would remind me of my family gatherings, eating and laughting together with my beloved."

Palestine Nights calming atmosphere, rich and tasty food and friendly staff are the combination that lets you feel at home."
